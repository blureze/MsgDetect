## MsgDetect
This is a chrome extension which can detect and get the user input while they are still typing.

## Method
In this project, I use setTimeInterval(2 secs) to detect whether the user is typing and extract the input.

## Installation
Install it by download the project and add it to your Google chrome browser.

## Test
Install the extension and open Facebook. Find a person and send a message to him/her.</br>
The result will be shown in the console.

The "checkFocus~" is the name of the function for debugging use.</br>
The number 1 represents that there is only one chatroom. (2 represents 2 chatrooms, and so on.)</br>
"name" represents the receiver's name.</br>
"hihi~~~" is the message you are typing.
